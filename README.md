### Program to give change in coins using a voracious algorithm
This program uses the currency that is passed to it in a file with its name and values â€‹â€‹via the command line or, if no file is passed, it works by default in euros (cents).
Besides it can be used in two different modes:
- Unlimited coins -> The algorithm will simply return the solution it finds without limitations.
- Limited coins -> A file with the stock will be passed and the program will limit the coins it returns to the stock that is available.
  It also allows you to expand the stock, adding 10 units to each available coin. Upon exit, the stock file is updated with the actual coins available.
